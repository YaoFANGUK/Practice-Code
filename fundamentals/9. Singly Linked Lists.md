# Singly Linked Lists

- A **singly linked list**, in its simplest form, is a collection of nodes that collectively form a liner sequence.
- Each node stores a reference to an object that is an element of the sequence, as well as a reference to the next node of the list.

- The list instance maintains a member named haead that identifies the first node of the list.
- In some applications another member named tail that identifies the last node of the list.

1. The first and last node of a linked list are known as the **head** and **tail** of the list.
2. We canidetify the tail as the node having None as its next reference.
3. This process is commonly known as **traversing** the linked list.

4. Because the next reference of a node can be viewed as a **link** or **pointer** to another node, the process of traversing a list is also known as **link hopping** or  **pointer hopping** 

5. Each node is represented as a unique object, with that instance storing a reference to its element and a reference to the next node (or None)

### 1. Inserting an Element

- An important property of a linked list is that it does not have a predetermined fixed size.
- It uses space proportional to its current number of elements

**To Insert a new element at the head of the list**:

1. Create a new node
2. Set its element to the new element
3. Set its next link to refer to the current head
4. Set the list's head to point to the new node

(a) Before the Insertion

(b) After creation of a new node

(c) After reassignment of the head reference

**To insert a new element at the tail of the list**

1. Create a new node
2. Assign its next reference to None
3. Set its next reference to the tail to point to this new node
4. Update the tail reference itself to this new node.

(a) Before the Insertion

(b) After creation of a new node

(c) After reassignment of the tail reference

Note that we must set the next link of the tail in (b) before we assign the tail variable to point to the new node in (c)



### 2. Removing an Element

Removing an element from the head of a singly linked list is essentially the reverse operation of inserting a new element at the head.

(a) Before the removal 

(b) After "linking" out the old head

(c) Final configration 

- We cannot easily delete the last node of a singly linked list.
- Even if we maintain a tail reference directly to the last node of the list, we must be able to access the node before the last node in order to remove the last node.
- But we cannot reach the node before the tail by following next links from the tail.
- If we want to support such an operation efficiently, we will need to make our list **doubly linked**
