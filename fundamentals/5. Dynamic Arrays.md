# Dynamic Arrays

- Don't need to specify how large an array is beforehand.
- **A list instance often has greater capacity than current length**
- If elements keeo getting appended, eventually this extra space runs out

Example of extra "room":

```python
import sys

# Set n 
n = 10

data = []

for i in range(n):
  # Number of elements
  a = len(data)
  #Actual Size in Bytes
  b = sys.getsizeof(data)
  
  print('Length:{0:3d}\t Size in Bytes: {1:4d}'.format(a,b))
  
  # increase length by one
  data.append(n)
```



# Dynamic Array Implementation

- The K=key is to provide means to grow the array **A** that stores the elements of a list.
- We cannot actually grow that array, since its capacity is fixed.
- If an element is appended to a list at a time when the underlying array is full, we will need to perform the following steps:
  	1. Allocate a new array B with larger capacity
   	2. Set B[i] = A[i], for i=0,...,n-1, where n denotes current number of items.
   	3. Set A = B, that is , we henceforth use B as the array supporting the list.
   	4. Insert the new element in the new array.
