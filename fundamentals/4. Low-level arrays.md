To avoid wasting spaces when storing an array of strings, Python represents a list or tuple instance using an internal storage mechanism of an array of object `references`, (This is somehow different from using `Numpy`).

- A single list instance may include multiple references to the same object as elements of the list.
- Single object can be an element of two or more lists.

As shown above, when computing a slice of a list, the result is a new list instance, but that new list has references to the same elements that are in the original list.



## Compact Arrays in Python

`Strings` are represented using an array of `characters` (not an array of `references`), which is called a `compact` array. Compact arrays have several advantages over referential structures in terms of computing performance.

Another important advantage to a compact structure for high-performance computing is that the primary data are stored consecutively in memory.

We can create a compact array as

```python
primes = array('i', [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17])
```

Compact arrays of such structures are based on C programming language and does NOT support user-defined data types.
