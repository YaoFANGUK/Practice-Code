Bridge = Learns MAC addresses in software

Switch = Learns MAC addresses much more quickly by using hardware ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits).



A bridge is an intermedia device between a switch and a hub



Hubs do not know what they are receiving but switches can 



Hub: dumb device repeats reverything that receives om one port out of all of the ports



Switch: more intelligence device uses MAC addresses learns where devices are.



When discussing the terms "port" and "interface" are often used interchangeably.



ADSL: Asymmetric digital subscriber line



**Routers today mix a lot of switching with them.**

A router will route from one network to another. For example, routing from Ethernet to serial or routing physical Ethernet to wireless. (i.e. routing from one connection type to another) 



Router has routing functionality in its most basic form. A router routes from one IP network to another. Routing from one physical media to a different physical media. This is typically used for connections to the Internet or to wide area networks.



- Hub: no intelligence
- Switch: intelligence based on MAC addresses
- Router: inltelligence based on IP addresses （连接外网WAN，现在Router有了switch的功能，所以家庭一般不需要单独买交换机）

现在一般**路由器**都自带**交换机的功能**。 **路由器**通常除了配**有**一个WAN口还**有**四个LAN口（这四个LAN口和**交换机**LAN口**功能**一样)，完全可以当**交换机**用！

The Romans had a divide and conquer policy. So we divide a problem into smaller parts and then we conquer smaller parts rather than trying todo everything in one go.



IPv4: Internet Protocol Version 4

TCP: Transmission Control Protocol

UDP: User Datagram Protocol

IPv6:  Internet Protocol Version 6



### Reason of three way handshake

- Client and server have to agree what port number we're goting to be talking. Client has to tell the server its ephemeral port number
